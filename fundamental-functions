#Making Lists, Appending Lists, User Input, Output

#This was my first attempt to undestand how to join together several basic functions as well as using f-strings.


#Using def and if/else to Generate Output
-----------------------------------------

#Define how to respond to User input
def response(choice):
    if choice == "vanilla":
        print("A classic choice!")
    elif choice == "chocolate":
        print("Oh! Rich and delicious!")

    else:

#Ask for User Input
flavour = input("What flavour ice cream do you like? ")
response(flavour)

#I found the mechanics of this a little confusing at first.
#But I think I understand both the connection and the seperation of the def function. 


#Repeating the Above Activity to Reinfoce Understanding
-------------------------------------------------------

def response(choice):
    if choice == "rock":
        print("A classic choice!")
    elif choice == "pop":

#Basic Adding and Multiplying Numbers with def
-------------------------------------

#Simple Addition
def add_five(number):
    return number +5
something1 = add_five(10)
print(something1)

#Simple Multiplication
def multiply_five(number):
    return number *5
something2 = multiply_five(10)
print(something2)

#Adding the Results
print(something1 + something2)
